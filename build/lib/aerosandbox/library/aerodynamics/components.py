    Computes the drag area (CDA) of the gaps associated with a typical wing control surface.
    (E.g., aileron, flap, elevator, rudder).

    The drag area (CDA) is defined as: CDA == D / q, where:

        - D is the drag force (dimensionalized, e.g., in Newtons)

        - q is the freestream dynamic pressure (dimensionalized, e.g., in Pascals)

    This drag area consists of two sources:

        1. Chordwise gaps at the side edges of the control surface ("side gaps")

        2. Spanwise gaps at the hinge line of the control surface ("hinge gap")

    Args:

        local_chord: The local chord of the wing at the midpoint of the control surface. [meters]

        control_surface_span: The span of the control surface. [meters]

        local_thickness_over_chord: The local thickness-to-chord ratio of the wing at the midpoint of the control
            surface. [nondimensional] For example, this is 0.12 for a NACA0012 airfoil.

        control_surface_hinge_x: The x-location of the hinge line of the control surface, as a fraction of the local
            chord. [nondimensional] Defaults to x_hinge / c = 0.75, which is typical for an aileron.

        n_side_gaps: The number of "side gaps" to count on this control surface when computing drag. Defaults to 2 (
            i.e., one inboard gap, one outboard gap), which is the simplest case of a wing with a single partial-span
            aileron. However, there may be cases where it is best to reduce this to 1 or 0. For example:

                * A wing with a single full-span aileron would have 1 side gap (at the wing root, but not at the tip).

                * A wing with a flap and aileron that share a chordwise gap would be best modeled by setting
                    n_side_gaps = 1 ( so that no double-counting occurs).

        side_gap_width: The width of the chordwise gaps at the side edges of the control surface [meters]. If this is
            left as the default (None), then a typical value will be computed based on the local chord and control surface
            span.

        hinge_gap_width: The width of the spanwise gap at the hinge line of the control surface [meters]. If this is
            left as the default (None), then a typical value will be computed based on the local chord.

    Returns: The drag area [m^2] of the gaps associated with the control surface. This should be added to the "clean"
        wing drag to get a more realistic drag estimate.
